# whatOdysseusDid
Facts that Homer claimed about Odysseus. These are his feats, as told by Homer, either through the mouth of Odysseus himself, or through the mouths of others, or by Homer the bard as the omniscient narrator.
The purpose is to collece all factual statements about Odysseus (as opposed to opinions, statements, and descriptions by the narrator). Facts are based on What Odysseus did, What he said he did, and what others say he did who witnessed what he did.
To put everything in order, and mark each fact by its place in the Book (chapter/line) according to a standard system.
To invite others to be editors and join the effort, and as they carefully read the book, provide any new Facts that are not already in this repo.
To encourage editors to dispute Facts as they are listed.
To encourage editors to add details, for example, the place in the book when missing.
